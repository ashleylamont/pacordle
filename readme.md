# PACordle

So... I heard wordle spinoffs were trending right now and everyone at ANU is trying to figure out their degree, so I figured what better way to capitalise on the situation, than to make a half-baked semi-vanilla-js (or ts as it were) wordle clone that uses ANU Degree codes for its data.

## Fair Use

This project utilises freely available data from ANU, such as program codes, which have been sourced from their Programs and Courses platform, and can be found in src/academic_codes_shuffled.json.

This project also uses gameplay mechanics from [Wordle](https://wordle.net/), which was created by [Josh Wardle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk) and is currently owned by [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/).

I believe that this project should fall under fair use with regards to the aforementioned assets, as:
- The work is purely non-commercial and no revenue is or will be generated from this project.
- The work is largely a parody of the original Wordle, and is not intended to be a substitute for the original, due to the ironically difficult gameplay.
- The work should not detract from the original Wordle, nor its value to the public.
- The work plays significantly differently, due to separate mechanics and data.
